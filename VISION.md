# Product Builder Agents - Vision Document

## The Problem
Building a product is hard:
1. Research competitors/market
2. Create specs and PRD
3. Build the actual product
4. Market it
5. Get feedback and iterate

## The Solution
An AI agent team that does ALL of this autonomously:

### The Agents

**1. Research Agent**
- Analyzes user request
- Researches market, competitors, similar products
- Identifies opportunities and risks
- Output: Market research report

**2. Spec Agent**
- Creates product requirements document (PRD)
- Designs feature list
- Chooses tech stack
- Designs architecture
- Output: Complete spec sheet + architecture

**3. Build Agent**
- Sets up project repo
- Writes code
- Deploys to production
- Output: Working product

**4. Marketing Agent**
- Creates landing page
- Writes marketing copy
- Posts on Product Hunt, Twitter, communities
- Output: Launch campaign

**5. Feedback Agent**
- Monitors reactions
- Collects user feedback
- Analyzes sentiment
- Output: Feedback report

**6. Iterate Agent**
- Prioritizes improvements
- Plans next steps
- Triggers Build Agent again
- Output: Iteration plan

## The Workflow

```
User: "Build me a SaaS for dog walkers"

Research Agent → Spec Agent → Build Agent → Marketing Agent
                                              ↓
User reviews     ← Feedback Agent ← Iterate Agent
```

## Target Audience
- Non-technical founders
- Entrepreneurs with ideas
- Side project builders
- People who want to validate ideas fast

## Monetization
- Free: 1 project
- Pro ($29/mo): 5 projects, faster agents
- Team ($99/mo): Unlimited, team features

## Differentiator
No other tool does end-to-end. Most tools do ONE thing:
- Cursor: builds code
- Linear: manages tickets
- Notion: docs

We do ALL OF IT.

## Current PM Analyzer Status
- Basic feedback collection: ✅ Done
- Simple analysis: ✅ Done
- Decision creation: ✅ Done
- Agent orchestration: ⏳ Need to build

## Next Steps
1. Research Agent implementation
2. A2A protocol for agent communication
3. Human-in-the-loop dashboard
4. Real integrations (GitHub, Stripe, etc.)
